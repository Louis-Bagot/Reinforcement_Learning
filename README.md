# Reinforcement_SuttonBarto
Implementations of the algorithms and methods learnt throughout the book [Reinforcement Learning : An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) by Sutton and Barto.

## Installing
The algorithms used here are tested on additions to the Gym package.
The render-supported versions I use are implemented in the `gym-additions` folder, forked from [Ond≈ôej Podsztavek's work](https://github.com/podondra/gym-gridworlds).

To paraphrase his README, the environments can be simply used :
```
$ import gym
$ import gym_gridworlds
$ env = gym.make('Gridworld-v0')  # substitute environment's name
```

This Reinforcement_SuttonBarto repository can then be simply forked and used freely.
